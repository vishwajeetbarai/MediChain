# MediChain
The "MediChain" project makes use of Metamask, Ganache, and the Ethereum blockchain to enable patients to securely upload and manage their medical data. Patients may conveniently monitor their data history, control doctor access, and upload their medical information. Physicians can create consulting reports, maintain patient lists, retrieve medical documents, and withdraw access that patients have already authorized.
Furthermore, by integrating the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), diagnostic centers can generate Electronic Health Record reports that guarantee patient and physician visibility into the health information. This decentralized system facilitates interoperability, greatly improves data security, and gives individuals more control over their health information. MediChain's new technique to managing electronic health records seeks to enhance patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
